## 📞 Support

If deployment fails:

1. **Check the logs** in Streamlit Cloud console
2. **Verify requirements.txt** has correct package versions
3. **Test locally first** with `streamlit run monster2.py`
4. **Check GitHub repository** is public or properly configured

Common issues:
- **Package conflicts:** Use `requirements-cloud.txt`
- **Playwright issues:** Cloud may have limitations
- **Memory limits:** Optimize image processing for cloud
