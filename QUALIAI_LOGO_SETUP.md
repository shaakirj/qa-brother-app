# Using Your QualiAI Logo as Favicon

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. Save your QualiAI logo image (the blue/teal gradient circular logo from the attachment) as `quali_logo.png` in the project root
2. Make sure it's in PNG format with transparency

### Step 2: Generate Favicon from Your Logo
```bash
# Run this command to create favicon from your logo:
./qa_env/bin/python create_favicon.py quali_logo.png
```

This will automatically:
- Resize your logo to all required favicon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64)
- Create both PNG and ICO formats
- Replace the default "Q" favicon with your actual QualiAI logo
- Maintain transparency and quality during resizing

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
git add static/
git commit -m "Updated favicon with QualiAI logo"
git push
```

## Manual Method (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

1. **Resize your logo manually:**
   - 32x32 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon.png`
   - 16x16 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon_16x16.png` 
   - 48x48 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon_48x48.png`
   - 64x64 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon_64x64.png`

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add static/
   git commit -m "Custom QualiAI favicon"
   git push
   ```

## Logo Specifications

For best results, your QualiAI logo should be:
- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Size:** At least 64x64 pixels (will be resized down)
- **Style:** The circular gradient design works perfectly for favicons
- **Colors:** The blue/teal gradient will show beautifully in browser tabs

## What You'll See

Once deployed:
- âœ… Browser tabs will show your QualiAI logo instead of generic emoji
- âœ… App header will display the logo next to "Quali AI" text
- âœ… Professional branding across all devices and browsers
- âœ… High-quality rendering on all screen resolutions

## Current Status

Right now, the app is using a generated "Q" favicon. Once you add your actual QualiAI logo and run the generator, it will be replaced with your professional logo design.

The circular gradient design from your logo will look excellent as a favicon! ðŸŽ¨
