# Using Your QualiAI Logo as Favicon

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. Save your QualiAI logo image (the blue/teal gradient circular logo from the attachment) as `quali_logo.png` in the project root
2. Make sure it's in PNG format with transparency

### Step 2: Generate Favicon from Your Logo
```bash
# Run this command to create favicon from your logo:
./qa_env/bin/python create_favicon.py quali_logo.png
```

This will automatically:
- Resize your logo to all required favicon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64)
- Create both PNG and ICO formats
- Replace the default "Q" favicon with your actual QualiAI logo
- Maintain transparency and quality during resizing

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
git add static/
git commit -m "Updated favicon with QualiAI logo"
git push
```

## Manual Method (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

1. **Resize your logo manually:**
   - 32x32 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon.png`
   - 16x16 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon_16x16.png` 
   - 48x48 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon_48x48.png`
   - 64x64 pixels â†’ Save as `static/favicon_64x64.png`

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add static/
   git commit -m "Custom QualiAI favicon"
   git push
   ```
